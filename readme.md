## Prerequisites to execute this project

This project needs *Node.js* to be executed.

If you don't have *Node.js* installed you can download it from the following link

[Go to Node.js download site](https://nodejs.org/)


## How to run this project?

1. Clone the repository on your local machine. It's recommended that you use another name for your local folder to avoid problems with other projects that use the same name:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/cmunerap/orderednumber.git orderednumber_cmunerap
    ```

2. From your favorite shell command tool, execute the program. Alternatively, you can supply an input file name. If you don't specify it, it will try to run the program with the default file *entrada.txt*

    This will try to run with a file 'entrada.txt' that should be located in the same path of the program
    ```
    node orderednumber.js
    ```

    This will try to run with the indicated file
    ```
    node orderednumber.js inputfile.txt
    ```

3. Check the results as expected in the same folder of the input file indicated. The file with the results should be named *salida.txt*

4. Don't forget to notify *Cristian Múnera* where he can claim the tickets for NGColombia :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
